Release Notes
=============

Contents:

   Please note that the Pulp Puppet Plugin is released every time Pulp platform is released.
   This may lead to some releases not having release specific notes. This means that no changes
   other than the version increase were made from the previous release.
   This is a problem that will be fixed with incoming Pulp3 plugin API.
