Troubleshooting
===============

.. note::
    "unknown error" during a consumer install operation can be caused by several
    underlying problems. The unknown aspect is unfortunately the result of a
    limitation of Puppet's own tool. It will occasionally produce output that is
    not in the expected JSON format, particularly when reporting errors, and then
    Pulp cannot parse the output. This is a known bug in Puppet that is being
    worked on.

SSL Certificate Verification Fails for Consumer Install
-------------------------------------------------------

Symptom
^^^^^^^

Installing a module on a consumer results in an "unknown error".

::

    $ pulp-admin puppet consumer install run --consumer-id client2 -u puppetlabs/stdlib
    This command may be exited via ctrl+c without affecting the request.

    [|]
    unknown error with module puppetlabs/stdlib

    Operation executed, but no changes were made.

Problem
^^^^^^^

This can be caused by an SSL verification error on the client. If the repository
is published over HTTPS and the ``puppet module install`` tool is not able to
verify the server's SSL certificate against a trusted CA, the ``puppet module install``
tool will return an error. Unfortunately, this is one of the cases where that tool
offers to return JSON output but then fails to do so, and thus Pulp is not able
to parse the error message. As soon as that behavior is fixed upstream, Pulp
will pass the error message through instead of reporting "unknown error".

Verification
^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can verify that this is the source of the problem by running the following
command on the consumer machine and looking for a similar error message about
SSL. Adjust the "consumer_id" and "hostname" as appropriate.

::

    $ sudo puppet module install --module_repository=http://consumer_id:.@hostname puppetlabs/stdlib
    Preparing to install into /etc/puppet/modules ...
    Downloading from http://consumer_id:.@hostname ...
    Error: SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B: certificate verify failed
    Error: Try 'puppet help module install' for usage

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Either don't publish repositories over HTTPS, or make sure the ``puppet module
install`` tool is able to verify the server's SSL certificate with a trusted CA.
Details on how to install a new trusted CA are outside the scope of this
document.

Missing metadata.json file
--------------------------

If uploading a puppet module results in `MissingMetadataFile` error, one possible problem is that the
tar.gz file being uploaded does not contain `metadata.json` file. Another possible problem is
presence of more than one directory (Puppet module) inside the archive.

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Modules must adhere to the `4.10+ metadata guidlines
<https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/modules_publishing.html>`_.
Also ensure that an uploaded archive contains only one Puppet module.

Incorrect Puppet module metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If metadata for a Puppet module in a Pulp repository doesn't match metadata in the `metadata.json`
module, the tar.gz archive contains multiple Puppet modules. Ensure that an
uploaded tar.gz file contains only one Puppet module.
